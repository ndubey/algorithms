Implementation in c++: Problem statement is to get two API: one for inserting ints, second for outputing elements in
such a way that in query `i` if `X` is output then in query `i+1` if `Y` is output then `Y > X`. 
For the first case you can output the lest element.
A `BST`is implemented which has API to insert elements and get the next succsessor. 
If an element which is less than last spit element is inserted then we will never output this.
